# `gen/` — Clang.jl bindings generator

This directory regenerates the raw ABI layer in
[`../src/lib/LibAccelerate.jl`](../src/lib/LibAccelerate.jl) directly from Apple's
Accelerate C headers, using [Clang.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/Clang.jl).

## Why

Accelerate's struct- and enum-heavy subframeworks (Quadrature, Sparse, BNNS) are
painful and error-prone to bind by hand — every C struct field offset and enum
value has to be transcribed and kept in sync with the SDK. Clang.jl reads the
headers and emits those definitions automatically, so the hand-written code in
`src/` only has to provide ergonomics, never ABI details.

The result is a conventional two-layer wrapper:

- **`src/lib/LibAccelerate.jl`** — generated, committed, *not* hand-edited. A 1:1
  mirror of the C API (structs, enums, `@ccall`s).
- **`src/quadrature.jl`, `src/array.jl`, …** — hand-written idiomatic Julia that
  calls into `LibAccelerate`.

## Usage

```sh
julia --project=gen gen/generate.jl
```

This reads headers from the active macOS SDK (resolved via `xcrun --show-sdk-path`,
so it needs Xcode or the Command Line Tools) and overwrites `src/lib/LibAccelerate.jl`.
The committed output is self-contained — **end users need only the runtime
framework that ships with every Mac**, not the headers or Clang.jl.

Generation is deterministic: re-running with the same SDK produces byte-identical
output, so CI can regenerate and diff to catch drift when a new SDK adds symbols.

## Scope

Generates the in-scope headers listed in [`generate.jl`](./generate.jl): vDSP,
vForce, vBasicOps, vfp, vectorOps, vBigNum, `Sparse/Solve.h` (the C solver API),
BNNS (+ graph), and Quadrature — ~900 functions, 110+ structs, 60 enums. Extend
coverage by appending headers to that list.

**Intentionally excluded:**
- BLAS/LAPACK (`cblas*.h`, `lapack*.h`, …) — forwarded via libblastrampoline, not
  ccall. They get transitively pulled in via `Sparse/Types.h`, so `generate.jl`
  post-processes the output to strip the `cblas_*`/`catlas_*`/`clapack_*` wrappers.
- `LinearAlgebra/` — C++ generics, not C-mappable.
- `Sparse/BLAS.h` dense×sparse multiply — C++ name-mangled (hand-wrapped elsewhere).

## Known limitations

- A few vDSP functions whose signatures use `arm_neon`/`simd` vector types or
  CoreFoundation-gated availability are dropped by libclang under the default GCC
  artifact include path (we capture ~93% of vDSP, all the pointer/length array
  ops). These SIMD-typed overloads are not part of the idiomatic surface anyway.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `generate.jl` | Entry point: resolves SDK paths, runs Clang.jl, strips out-of-scope BLAS |
| `generator.toml` | Clang.jl options (module name, library, enum style, …) |
| `prologue.jl` | Spliced into the generated module — `libacc` + BNNSGraph opaque handles |
| `shims/bnns_graph_shim.h` | Neutralizes availability attributes that break Clang.jl |
| `Project.toml` | Pins Clang.jl for the generator environment |
